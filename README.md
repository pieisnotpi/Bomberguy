# Bomberguy

A Java-based clone of Bomberman, based on the Pi-Engine.

Still very much in development, though it is technically playable if you enjoy restarting the game after every match. It does include a highly primitive level editor, however, so. Yeah.

Here for version control!

Requires at least LWJGL 3.1.2 build 13, JOML 1.9.0, and the latest Pi-Engine build
